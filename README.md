## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing loan distribution and borrower patterns in a microfinance setting. Using Power BI, the goal was to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into loan distribution across countries, sectors, borrower gender, and loan repayment status. This analysis offers valuable information on borrower demographics and sectoral involvement, helping microfinance institutions better understand borrower needs and repayment trends.

## Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the [Kiva_loans](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret/blob/master/datasets/kiva.csv) file, containing detailed information about each Loans given by the company.

## Skills and Tools Used
* **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Power BI’s Power Query Editor was used to clean and prepare the data, including handling missing values, ensuring consistent data types, and formatting categorical data.
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI was used to create bar charts, donut charts, and card visuals to display loan distribution across countries, sectors, and loan status, along with borrower gender distribution.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** DAX measures and calculations were employed to aggregate and filter data, such as calculating average loan amounts and creating measures for loan status counts.
  
## Project Scope

The project aimed to:
* **Analyze Loan Distribution:**
Visualize loan amounts across countries, highlighting key areas of microfinance activity.
Breakdown loan amounts by industry sector to identify major sectors of loan allocation.
* **Understand Borrower Demographics:**
Show borrower gender distribution and compare average loan amounts by gender.
* **Examine Loan Status and Nonpayment Responsibility:**
Provide insights into loan repayment status and track responsibility for nonpayment.
* **Interactive Features:**
Enable slicers for filtering by country, sector, gender, and loan status to allow dynamic exploration of data.

## Results/Findings
The dashboard provided the following insights:
* **Country-Wise Loan Distribution:** A bar chart showed significant loan volumes in certain countries, highlighting key markets for microfinance institutions.
* **Sectoral Loan Allocation:** The analysis revealed high loan allocations in sectors such as Retail and Food, indicating targeted microfinance support in these industries.
* **Gender Analysis:** The gender distribution of borrowers displayed a higher proportion of female borrowers, often with slightly smaller average loan amounts compared to male borrowers.
* **Loan Repayment Insights:** The breakdown of active versus paid-off loans provided an understanding of repayment rates, and nonpayment responsibility analysis helped reveal default management between lenders and partners.-
- This project’s findings help illustrate microfinance lending patterns and borrower demographics, providing data-driven insights for effective decision-making in microfinance operations.
